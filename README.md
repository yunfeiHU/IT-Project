1.1       Purpose
The Internet has grown at a rapid pace and although there are an abundance of applications – both on 
the web and on handheld devices that can make a difference to people’s lives in practical ways, there
is a gap in the market for development of applications that cater to people with sentimental desires.
In particular, there is an absence in a website that can track and document significant items and
artefacts for people to be able to view the story behind a particular artefact. Due to the lack of the
aforementioned app, the purpose of this project is to build a website that allows users to create
stories from their personal items for themselves and other people who come across the item in the
future so that the importance of it is not lost through generations. This website will serve as an
archive of treasured items that can be viewed at any time, and will be stored indefinitely.

1.2       Product Scope
The application’s scope will be a simple, aesthetically pleasing website focused more on the
storytelling of the artefacts and will contain both visual and infographic elements to it. A
typical user will be able to add, view, edit and delete aspects of the artefact such as the
image used and description of the artefact. There will be an option to keep the artefact private
or share it publicly and other users will be able to search for items with specific tags or words
associated with it. If the user wants to discontinue their account, the option of deleting their
account and associated photos will be available. A user will have a collection of their most recent
uploaded artefacts on their dashboard upon signing into their user account to coincide with the
sentimental approach of the website.
